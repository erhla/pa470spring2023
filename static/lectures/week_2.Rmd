## Spatial Data {.build}

Real world problems **require** accurate projections of geographic relationships.

- Find the ten neighborhoods in a city with the longest fire department response times.
- Use real-time satellite imagery to detect early warnings of forest fires.
- Detect changes in high-resolution satellite imagery that suggest building additions that do not match official building permits.
- Estimate the impact of bar openings on nearby crime, business patterns, and property values.
- Determine whether low-income households face a higher risk of sea-level rise.

## Spatial Data

- Objects: sets of points which create shapes like roads/buildings
- Fields: spatially continuous processes like temperature

## Vectors

- Point, each group has one point
- Lines, each group has multiple, ordered points
- Polygons, each group has multiple, ordered points, with first/last point the same

CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON

### Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

Key to project points onto Earth's surface

Very common are 4326 or 4269 (census)
